This lesson is an introduction to virtual machines and software containers.

### Lesson outline

- Overview: when do you want to use virtual environments and containers
- Virtual Macines and Vagrant
- Docker
- Singularity


### Lesson requirements

It is essential to have a basic understanding of:
- Command line and shell

Although not essential it is helpful to have an understanding of:
- Package manager
- Git/Github


####  Overview: when do you want to use virtual environments and containers
- A general motivation, problem with packaging (resources needed)
- Differences between VMs and containers (using: https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b#.kchrpokfz)


#### Virtual Macines and Vagrant
- Intro to VMs: using and configuring VirtualBox (using: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html)
- Using Vagrant with VirtualBox (using: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/)


#### Docker
- Intro to Docker: using and creating containers (using: https://neurohackweek.github.io/docker-for-scientists/, http://www.slideshare.net/chrisfilo1/docker-for-scientists, https://prakhar.me/docker-curriculum/) 
- Using Jupyter with Docker (using: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/docker-data-science/)

#### Singularity
- Intro	to Docker: using and creating containers (using: http://singularity.lbl.gov/about, https://github.com/cjprybol/reproducibility-via-singularity)
